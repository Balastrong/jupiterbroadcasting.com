# Podcasting 2.0

Podcasting 2.0 is an umbrella term that covers a collection of initiatives to advance podcasting technology and to decentralize podcasting, taking control of the medium out of the hands of large technology companies.

Boosts are a new way to send a bit of value into the show, while including a personal message.
