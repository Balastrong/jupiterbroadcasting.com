Boosts are a new way to send a bit of value into the show while including a personal message. We feature as many Boosts as we can as a thank you, and to add a bit of value to your Boost.

Boosts use the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/). Free software that makes it possible to send value to anywhere in the world instantly, for exceptionally low fees.

### The "Value for Value" Model

Jupiter Broadcasting is an independent media company focusing on niche topics our community loves. We know it will not get us a million downloads an episode, and we're probably never going viral on social media. But our community finds value in our work, and your support keeps us going.

The listener is asked to share the value they get from listening to the podcast. This usually means sending a boost or becoming a [member](https://jupiterbroadcasting.net/membership/). Boosts can be a quick one-off, or an ongoing way to send value into the show and get your voice heard. 

Some of our favorite Boosts are ones that get us thinking and talking. They often can bring something new and random to the episode we would have never planned.

Alternative contributions are also welcome. Examples include participating in our Mumble room, helping out in our community, sharing an episode with friends, and many more. 

### Ways to Boost

First you'll need some [sats](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit)) and there are many ways to do this. If you're in the US the simplest way we know of is to use [the Strike app](https://strike.me/) and outside the US [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/). See below for a privacy focused method as well.

Once you have aquired your sats, you send them to a Podcasting 2.0 compatiable app.

We recommend:
* [Fountain](https://www.fountain.fm/) - Android, Web, iOS
* [Castamatic](https://castamatic.com/) - iOS
* [Breez](https://breez.technology/) - Android, iOS (Not a Podcast app, so you don't have to switch!)
* [Podverse](https://podverse.fm/) - Android, F-Droid, Web, iOS
* [BoostCLI](https://github.com/valcanobacon/BoostCLI) - Command-line tool to send and review Podcasting 2.0 Value (also not a podcast app).


### Podcasting 2.0

Podcasting 2.0 is an umbrella term that covers a collection of initiatives to advance podcasting technology and to decentralize podcasting, taking control of the medium out of the hands of large technology companies.

The front of that effort is the [Podcast Index.[(https://podcastindex.org/)

> When Dave Jones and I started this open project with an open source policy and transparency of mission, we uncorked over a decade of pent up creative energy from app developers, hosting companies and podcasters. [Podcastindex.org](https://www.podcastindex.org/) offers a rich API that 58 apps and services today are building on. Thanks to our value4value model, all participants in the ecosystem are in the value flow. This is a huge departure from the traditional app store sale. The passion is rooted in collective success that rewards each individually, with actual value that users determine. Not meager crumbs from big tech.
